openstory
=========

A windows based RPG game made with RPGMaker

Not much else to say... until we can find a better framework, we might be stuck using the proprietary RPGMaker

Target Audience
=
18-28 year olds who grew up playing video games, reading books, and thoroughly immersing themselves in fantasy and feel somewhat lost and dejected IRL.


Themes
=
As Andrew Stanton says, one critical thing that a story great is the persistence of themes (in the case of Lawrence of Arabia: "Who are you?"). In my case, I need to decide from the beginning the themes of OpenStory which will set the overarching tones of this story.

For the purposes of empathsizing with the 18-28 year olds who are, no doubt, going through their own journeys of self-discovery and finding their own places in life, I will go with the following overarching theme:

  > What's my place in the world?

The answer, of course, is in the beginning - the small town from where you came from.

Outline
=
Ideas are pinned in here not necessarily in chronological order, but at least in such a way that it eventually creates a cohesive trilogy

* \MC runs an armor shop in an small town selling mildly outdated armor to adventurers in a rapidly digitalizing age
* \MC is contacted by a mythic old man character who does not inform him of anything but just sets him down the path of adventure...
* \MC's local rival, \LC1 successfully drives the MC out of the city on trumped up charges forcing \MC to chase after some red herring
* \MC goes on his first quest through the big city with his party to retrieve knowledge and learn of the on-coming evil
* \MC gets a feel for the scope of his quest and wins a minor victory against the first \VC1 . \MC is on bad terms with \LC1 and on okay terms with \LC2.
* \MC has been thoroughly defeated and, as a consequence, \SC1 has been killed. However, \MC's friends and enemies come together and help him out of this hard time.
* \MC betrays his party for \LC2, is forced to confront his own demons as well as that of his friends. His resolve strengthens
* \MC returns to the small town with a bigger inventory and continues his old business except with a better understanding of himself
