OpenStory Script (Draft)
=
We follow standardd storyboarding practices as setup by Aristotle way back when. The structural rules for a standard trilogy are as follows (shown as a file tree)

However, we've come a long way since the classics, so it makes sense to tell add another section between books and acts... and because this is the storyboard for a game, we can map some of the diction

- Books (3 in a trilogy)
-- Arcs (9)
--- Acts (27)
---- Sequences (81)
----- Scenes (> 243)
------ Shots + Cuts (> 729)
